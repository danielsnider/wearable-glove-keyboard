#Wearable Glove Keyboard
The most common english letters are mapped to the most convientent "touch points" on the the [Pregrine gaming glove](http://theperegrine.com/product/). The device works like a keyboard on any computer. Also, GlovePIE software (windows only) is used for voice feedback so you can hear what you are typing while you stare at the key mappings... This is a completely unpractical keyboard replacement but was lots of fun to try out!

2. For Windows 8 users only, download [d3dx9_33.dll], and copy it to GlovePIE's program files.. 
3. Open `voice-feedback.PIE` in GlovePIE.
4. Click run.
